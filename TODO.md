# Portfolio Creation Plan

## Information Gathered
- Current index.html has basic sections: hero (header), about, projects, contact, footer.
- style.css has minimal styling with Inter font, basic layout, and colors.
- The portfolio needs to be enhanced to resemble a modern site like https://bryllim.com/, assuming it has a clean, professional design with sections for introduction, work/projects, about, and contact.

## Plan
- Update index.html: Add more detailed content, placeholders for images, better structure, and additional sections if needed (e.g., skills or testimonials).
- Update style.css: Improve styling with modern colors, gradients, responsive design, animations, and better typography.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- index.html
- style.css

## Followup Steps
- Test the site by opening index.html in a browser.
- Confirm with user if it matches the desired example or needs further adjustments.

- [x] Updated index.html with personalized content, more projects, and better structure.
